# Subscription Management Application

This application is part of my engineering thesis project. It is designed to help users manage their subscriptions (e.g., Netflix, Spotify) by providing tools for setting up notifications, tracking expenses, and organizing subscription details in an intuitive way.

- **Expense Dashboard**: View and track monthly subscription costs in one place.
- **Notifications**: Set up reminders for upcoming payments or subscription renewals.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive UI for a seamless experience.
